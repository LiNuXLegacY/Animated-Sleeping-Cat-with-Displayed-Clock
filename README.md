# Animated-Sleeping-Cat-with-Displayed-Clock
This Python Tkinter code animates a slowed background GIF with a resized cat GIF positioned near a bike. It extracts and resizes frames using Pillow to preserve transparency and smooth animation. A green digital clock updates every second at the top-right corner, creating an engaging animated GUI.
